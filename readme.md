# Simple Rest API with Oauth 2.0 authentification

## Purpose
This is to test nodeJS as a rest interface backend


## Inspiration
### Original guide
https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/08/21/build-secure-rest-api-with-node

### Divergences
1. epilogue did not play well with the newest equelize so it has been replaced with finalize
2. added JSON error handler to avoid  html errors
